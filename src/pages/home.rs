                    Coding Pirates. This is where my passion for programming
                    ignited. I soon started learning the basics of HTML, CSS
                    and JavaScript, and quickly moved on to bigger frameworks
                    like React and Svelte."

                    a big interest in Rust, where I have been learning all kinds
                    of different principles. Rust has really taught me how code
                    should be written and how to think about code in a more

                    and security principles that help me build more robust
                    applications. These interests complement my programming
                    skills and have shaped my approach to creating secure
