                    Coding Pirates. This is where my passion for programming
                    ignited. I soon started learning the basics of HTML, CSS
                    and JavaScript, and quickly moved on to bigger frameworks

                    a big interest in Rust, where I have been learning all kinds
                    of different principles. Rust has really taught me how code
